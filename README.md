# Creating Tables for AWS Instance
This python code will create and fill tables with fake data and put it into an AWS instance. Inorder to fill up the tables with fake data I used a Python package called Faker. This is a template that you can use to write your own code since the tables for this code was made specifically for the project that I needed to do. Also dont forget to put in your own info to connect into your AWS instance.
